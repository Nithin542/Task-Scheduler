# Task-Scheduler
A Task Scheduler project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a web-based tool designed to enable users to create and manage scheduled tasks. The interface allows users to set specific dates for their tasks, with options to edit or delete them. It employs CSS for an appealing design, JavaScript for dynamic functionality, and local storage or backend integration to save and retrieve scheduled tasks. Users can access and interact with their scheduled tasks through this web application, aiding in time management and organization.

In our task scheduler, users can enter their tasks and set the priority, whether it's high, low, or somewhere in between, and define the task's deadline. After adding a task, users can conveniently view all upcoming tasks in the "Upcoming Tasks" section. When a user completes a task and press "mark done", it is automatically moved to the "Completed Tasks" section, allowing users to keep track of their accomplishments. Additionally, users have the option to view all completed tasks as well as upcoming tasks in one place for efficient task management.
